# Encrypted Tux

Welcome to the Encrypted Tux project, a class 11 computer science Python project created by Ansh Chauhan of class 11 studying in SRDAV Public School. üêß

Our project, started on January 1st, 2022, is all about helping Linux users achieve complete anonymity and privacy online. We believe that everyone has the right to privacy and security online, and we're here to help you achieve that with Linux. Our project provides a comprehensive guide on how to use various tools and techniques to encrypt your internet connection, secure your personal information, and stay lowkey online.

This project is for anyone who wants to take their online privacy and security to the next level and learn how to become the ghost in the machine. Whether you're a Linux novice or an experienced user, we got you covered. Our guide includes step-by-step instructions and explanations, as well as tips and tricks for using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), The Onion Router (Tor), encryption, and more. We also review Linux-based privacy tools and share tips and tricks for staying anonymous online.

As time passes, we plan to improve the project by adding more information and resources on how to secure and encrypt your data, how to use VPNs and Tor, and more. We will also be updating the project with new and more advanced features. We are also planning to expand the project to include guides and resources for other operating systems as well, to help users of all types achieve online anonymity and privacy.

Our goal is to make the project a one-stop-shop for all your online privacy and security needs. We will be constantly updating the project with new features, new tools, and new information to keep you up-to-date with the latest developments in the field of online privacy and security.

We also plan to create a community of users who can share their own experiences and tips for achieving online anonymity and security.

We encourage you to explore our project and learn more about the various tools and techniques available for achieving complete anonymity and privacy online. Join us as we navigate the ever-changing landscape of privacy and security on Linux.
